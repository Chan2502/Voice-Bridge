VOICE BRIDGE :  TRANSFORMING GESTURES INTO TEXT AND AUDIO

Problem defination :
The project aims to bridge the communication divide between the normal people and individuals with speech or hearing impairments. The challenge lies in the absence of an effective system to accurately translate sign language into text or audio, thereby hindering the ability of people with disabilities to enjoy equal opportunities in social interactions, employment, and education. The objective of the project is to develop a sophisticated deep learning model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to recognize words in Indian Sign Language (ISL) from gestures. The ultimate goal is to create a real-time translation system that fosters inclusivity and provides an intuitive interface, facilitating seamless communication between individuals with and without disabilities.
